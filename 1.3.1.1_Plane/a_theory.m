% 1) The equation of the plane in vector form
% r*n=p
% here r=x*i+y*j+z*k is radius vector of current point M(x,y,z)
% n=cos(alfa)*i+cos(beta)*j+cos(gamma)*k is unit vector 
% perpendicular to the plane
% When going to coordinates
% x*cos(alfa)+y*cos(beta)+z*cos(gamma)-p=0

% 2) The equation of every plane
% A*x+B*y+C*z+D=0
% A,B,C are the coordinates of some vector 
% N=A*i+B*j+C*k perpendicular to the plane
% To reduce the equation of the plane to the normal form, 
% multiply all the terms of the equation 
% by the normalizing factor
% mu=+-1/N=+-1/sqrt(A^2+B^2+C^2)

% 3) If D/=0 we divide all the terms of the equation by -D
% the equation of the plane can be reduced to the form
% x/a+y/b+z/c=1
% here a=-D/A, b=-D/B, c==D/C
% This equation is called the equation of a plane in segments.
