% Area of a flat figure

% If f (x, y) = 1 in the integral
% int int (R) f(x,y) dxdy, then the double integral 
% is equal to the area of the integration region R

% The area of the region of type I (elementary with respect to the axis Oy) 
% is expressed in terms of the repeated integral in the form
% A = int (a-b) int (g(x)-h(x)) dy dx

% Similarly, the area of a region of type II (elementary with respect 
% to the axis Ox) is described by formula
% A = int (c-d) int (p(y)-q(y) dx dy
