% Alternating series. Absolute and conditional convergence.


% A number series containing an infinite set of positive and 
% an infinite set of negative terms is called alternating. 
% A special case of the alternating series is the alternating series,
% that is, a series in which consecutive terms have opposite signs.

% Leibniz sign
% For the alternating series there is a sufficient criterion 
% for Leibniz's convergence.

% Let {a(n)} be a numerical sequence such that

% 1. a(n+1) < a(n) for all n;
% 2. limit(n->inf)a(n)=0

% Then the alternating series
% sum(n=1:inf)(-1)^n*a(n) and sum(n=1:inf)(-1)^(n-1)*a(n) converge.

% Absolute and conditional convergence

% A series sum(n=1:inf)a(n) is said to be absolutely convergent 
% if the series sum(n=1:inf)|a(n)| also converges.

% If the series sum(n=1:inf)a(n) converges absolutely, 
% then it is convergent (in the usual sense). 
% The converse is not true.

% A series sum(n=1:inf)a(n) is said to be conditionally convergent 
% if it itself converges, and the series composed of the moduli 
% of its terms diverges.
