% Interval and radius of convergence

% Consider the function 
% f(x) = sum (n=1:inf) a(n)*(x-x0)^n 
% Its domain of definition is the set of those values of x 
% for which the series converges.
% The domain of definition of such a function is called 
% the interval of convergence.

% If the interval of convergence is represented in the form 
% (x0-R, x0+R), where R > 0, then R is called the radius of convergence.

% The radius of convergence can be calculated using 
% the radical Cauchy test, using formula
% R=limit(n->inf)1/a(n)^(1/n)

% or on the basis of d'Alembert's sign
% R = limit (n->inf) |a(n)/a(n+1)|
